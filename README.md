# Lancer Hacking Guide

## What The Hack?
### The Point
This a guide on how Hacking and being a Hacker works in the Lancer system. Hacking in Lancer can mean both aiding your allies and foiling your enemies. Generally you will have a number of interesting decisions to make on your turn as to both whom to effect, and how to effect them. There will be types of enemy that you will be very effective against, like big tanky bosses, and enemies like monstrosities that you are really not. If that sounds interesting, read on. Throughout this guide I will mix explanation with my own analysis, if I miss anything, please feel free to message me or submit a pull request.
### Actions
When I talk about hacking in Lancer I am speaking specifically about the Tech Action. The Tech action can be taken as either a Quick or Full action. There are multiple options for what the Tech action accomplishes, and unlike other actions, the same option can be selected twice by using the Full Tech Action. The starting options are as follows
#### Bolster
This grants +2 dice on a Skill or Save, if a teammate is in a situation where failure is likely or retries are hard, this can be very effective. Take care though to consider action economy for this option.
#### Scan
Providing a few combat details and narrative information, this action is situationally very important.
#### Lock-On
This Action inflicts the Lock-On status to one enemy within sensors. Lock-On can be consumed for a +1 die on an attack roll, as well as triggering many special abilities.
#### Invade
Invade is the primary offensive option, it requires a Tech Attack, and on hit inflicts 2 Heat and a chosen effect. You begin with one effect to choose from and can gain more with Systems upgrades. It is worth noting that all Invades are Tech Attacks, but not all Tech Attacks are Invades.
### Damage vs. Heat
Ranged and Melee Attacks mostly cause Damage, and occasionally add Heat. Tech Attacks mostly cause Heat and occasionally Damage. Each enemy will have a different amount of HP and Heat Cap. Notably, Grunts can be taken out when they suffer any Heat or Damage.
### Support vs. Control
In addition to directly causing Heat or Damage, Mechs can support their allies, or control their enemies. Support is frequently making that ally's actions easier, though it can also be healing, clearing conditions, creating cover etc. Controlling means making an enemy's job harder, this can mean directly causing Conditions and Statuses, making an area dangerous to enter, or dictating actions of an enemy. Tech Actions are good at both of these, but are by no means the only way to accomplish support or control.
### Attacks vs. Saves
Every character has an Evasion and an E-Defense. Tech Attacks always target E-Defense, Ranged or Melee Attacks target Evasion unless they have the Smart tag. Each character also has 4 Saves: Hull, Agility, Systems, and Engineering. Often, high Evasion and Agility saves go hand in hand, as do high E-Defense and System Saves. It is good to both bring a mix of ways to attack an enemy, and to be mindful of what defenses a given enemy might be good at when selecting your mode of attack. For example, if an enemy is described as a slow moving heavily armor Mech, a Tech Attack or Agility save would probably be more effective than a traditional attack or Hull save.

## Building the Character
### Theme or Goal
We know that your character is a hacker, but what are they trying to accomplish? You might want to be a front-line combat hacker who can take a hit and melt their opponents with Heat. You might want to be an evasive hacker who flits in and out of battle assisting their allies. Before getting out of LL0, I would answer two questions about my hacker: 'What kind of Tech Actions do I want to perform?' and 'How am I going to stay alive while I do that?'. 
### HASE
Of the four Mech Skills, Systems is the most important. In addition to providing a bonus to your Tech Attack, it also provides more System Points which can allow your Mech to bring a broader array of tools to accomplish its chosen task. I would caution though against putting too many points into Systems; E-Defense does not increase too much as your LL increases, and Mech Systems aren't any good if you don't find time to use them. Hull and Agility can each increase survivability, and while few Tech Action options suffer from Limited or cost Heat many of the other options for Support or Control do and thus benefit from Engineering.
### Talents
#### Hacker
Needless to say, the Hacker talent is useful for many hacker characters.
Hacker I Provides the victim of a Lock-On Invade with a choice of suffering 2 Heat or moving 3 hexes in a direction you choose. Even if you must provide your own Lock-On before Invading, this can be viable if you are worried about missing or if both options would be bad for the target.
Hacker II Provides three additional Invade options, which are covered in the Invade Option section.
Hacker III Is a Full Tech Attack that causes Burn equal to current Heat, which can be very useful against high Armor targets.
#### Nuclear Cavalier & Infiltrator
Both Nuclear Cavalier I and Infiltrator II provide conditional bonuses to Attacks of any type, which means that you can add Heat (Nuclear Cavalier I) or a Save effect (Infiltrator II) to your Tech Attacks.
#### Spotter
Spotter increases the effectiveness of your Lock-On Tech Action
Spotter I will increase the Support effectiveness of your Lock-On.
Spotter II grants you extra Lock-Ons, and more importantly give you the full defensive profile of anyone you Lock-On, allowing you to select the most effective way to address that enemy.
Spotter III allows you to gift a Quick Action to an adjacent ally when you Lock-On, this can be situationally very powerful, but doesn't increase the overall number of actions your team gets.
### Core Bonuses
There are two Core Bonuses that directly make your Tech Actions better
####  HORUS: THE LESSON OF THINKING-TOMORROWâ€™S THOUGHT
This gives Melee Accuracy and AP+ when you succeed with a Tech Attack, this is an obvious fit for any frontline hacker character.
#### HORUS: THE LESSON OF THE HELD IMAGE
This allows you to Lock-On as a Reaction, as this effectively gives you a free Quick Action every turn it is very powerful and even more so if you have improved your Lock-On with the Spotter Talent.
#### Others
Often, a hacker character will use their Core Bonuses to increase their survivability, but there are a few that deserve special mention.
##### HORUS: THE LESSON OF THE OPEN DOOR
Many Tech Actions provoke saves as do many of the other control options. The combination of the increased Target and the Heat make this essential for anyone relying on Save-based attacks.
##### SSC: GHOSTWEAVE
While this doesn't _directly_ make your Tech Action better, if you are trying to trigger Infiltrator II this Core Bonus can be very useful.

## Building The Mech
When looking at a Mech Frame in regards to your hacker character, it is worth discussing both the Tech Actions etc. that the License grants as well as the suitability of the Frame as a hacker's Mech. The essential stats for this are the Save Target, The Tech Attack Bonus, and the Sensor range. Many Mechs also have special abilities that make Tech Actions and their companion actions easier.
### GMS
#### Everest (S: 10, TA: +0, ST:10)
At LL0 this is your Mech, but even at higher LLs it can be a solid hacker platform due to it's special ability and core system. Opening a tough fight with a HYPERSPEC FUEL INJECTOR, Overcharge and INITIATIVE would allow you 4x Accurate Invade Actions and plenty of movement which could change the whole course of the combat.
### IPS-N
#### Lancaster (S: 8, TA: +1, ST: 10)
Even with it's lackluster Sensor stat, the Lancaster is the only dedicated healing Mech in the game, and thus a strong choice for a supportive build. Given the shorter Sensor range it would be good to focus on Hull to increase both your survivability and Repair Cap.
#### Raleigh (S: 10, TA: -1 ST: 10)
Definitely not a classic hacker platform, the Raleigh bears mentioning due to the Trait FULL METAL JACKET. This Trait allows a free reload of all Loading weapons if you don't make attacks or provoke saves on a turn, which makes a hybrid attack and support build very possible by unloading your weapons and then spending a turn Locking On etc. though the lacluster Tech Attack bonus means that you probably want to avoid offensive hacking.

### SSC
#### Black Witch (S: 15, TA: +0, ST: 11)
The Black Witch combines good Sensor and Save Target with some strong defensive Traits to make a solid control-centered hacking platform. The ICEOUT Drone (BW II) can be a low-investment way to foil an enemy hacker, as can the Black ICE Module (BW III).

#### Death's Head (S: 20, TA: +0, ST: 10)
The Death's Head II License provides the Tracking Bug Quick Tech option, which is a great way to prevent invisible enemies from giving you trouble. Additionally it's excellent Sensor range makes it a strong candidate for a support artillery hybrid build.

#### Dusk Wing (S: 10, TA: +1, ST: 11)
Neurospike (DW I) provides a couple of good defensive control options, and the rest of the license provides a number of ways to mess with visibility and provoke saves. It is worth noting that the trait Harlequin Cloak is redundant with Infiltrator I for the purposes of triggering Infiltrator II, though it can provide needed enemy Reaction defense. With both a good Tech Attack Bonus and Save Target, the Dusk Wing is a solid frame choice for a Heat or control based hacker, though you will likely need another license for more Invade options.

#### Metal Mark (S: 10, ST: 10)
The Metal Mark License doesn't offer much to directly aid Tech Actions, but both the Core System and Active Camoflauge (MM III) make it very easy to provoke Infiltrator II.

#### Mourning Cloak (S: 15, ST: 10)
The Mourning Cloak license is actually focused around Teleporting hit and run attacks, but the Frame does have good Sensor range and MC II provides Hunter Logic Sweet which allows for two Invade options.

#### <font color="cyan">Swallowtail</font> (S: 20, ST: 10)
With 20 Sensor range and the trait PROPHETIC SCANNERS, Swallowtail is the gold standard of Lock-On support mechs. The INTEGRATED CLOAK also synergizes nicely with Infiltrator I to set up Infiltrator II. The first License Level provides a Full Tech Attack that causes both Heat and Lock-On, as well as allowing you to use a Reaction to upgrade an ally's hit to a critical; as this competes with Invade + Lock-On it is really only useful if you have an ally that loves crits. Finally the ATHENA-Class NHP can provide AOE Lock-On and the LB/OC Cloaking Field AOE invisibility, both at the third License Level.

### HORUS
#### Balor (S: 5, TA: +1, ST: 10)
The Balor is an odd mech for a hacker, the low Sensor range pushes it clearly to a front-line role, which is further aided by Scanner Swarm (B I) that gives Accuracy to Tech Attacks on adjacent enemies, as well as the potent Regeneration Trait. With easy access to Accuracy, you can shift some Mech Skills from Systems to Hull which can greatly increase the Balor's survivability. It is worth noting that many of the Balor's weapons have the Smart tag, so it may be difficult to effect high E-Defense targets with just the equipment in the license.

#### <font color="cyan">Goblin</font> (S: 20, TA: +2, ST: 11)
The Goblin is the gold standard for a Tech Attack based hacker frame, with +2 and permanent Accuracy on Tech Attacks you hardly need to focus on the Systems Skill to hit regularly. There are a plethora of Tech Action goodies in this license so I will run them down individually.
##### Goblin I
This level has Autopod which allows you to take a Reaction to auto-hit for 3 Damage when an Ally consumes a Lock-On, obviously a great way to add Damage to a support build. It also allows H0R_OS System Upgrade I which provides two excellent control Invade options.
##### Goblin II
In addition to the frame itself, this license level grant Metahook which allows you to hack from even farther away, and H0R_OS System Upgrade II which provides non-Invade Tech Actions which can either create cover or make an illusory duplicate of a target which forces Systems saves when enemies attempt to attack it.
##### Goblin III
The final level of Goblin license provides two more Invade options in the form of H0R_OS System Upgrade III, as well as an NHP that provides access to the Action Hurl Into Duat. This Action is a Quick Tech that causes 2 Heat and an effect, but is not an Invade and is notably limited to once per round. The effect rotates through four modes, the first 3 are classic control and condition application, but the forth allows you to dictate all of the actions of an enemy. Notably, you needn't direct all four actions at the same target, so you can power up OSIRIS on low E-Defense before setting up a tougher target with a Lock-On for the Fourth Gate.

#### Gorgon (S: 8, TA: +1, ST: 12)
The Gorgon, while not a dedicated hacker's mech, has a strong Save Target, and the //SCORPION V70.1 module which punishes those who try and fail Tech Actions against you. The Gaze Trait also synergizes well with the Lesson of the Held Image Core Bonus. 

#### Hydra (S: 10, TA: +1, ST: 10)
The Hydra is first and foremost a drone focussed mech. It has solid base stats, and does provide a Quick Tech action (H I) although this action is entirely drone dependent.

#### Manticore (S: 10, TA: +1, ST: 10)
The Manticore license provides a pair of Invade options at each of level I and II, while potent, many of these options cause electric damage to you and are thus most likely to be effective when you use the Manticore as your frame for its electrical resistance.

#### <font color="cyan">Minotaur</font> (S: 8, TA: +1, ST: 11)
After the Goblin, the Minotaur is probably the most Tech Action focussed license and frame. Your Core System passive allows for a Quick Action that upgrades Slowed to Immobilized and Immobilized to Stunned after hitting with a Tech Attack, while this is often less total control than doing a second Tech Attack, it is always successful. The Core System Active also can be made even more potent with the Disable Life Support Invade option from Hacker II. Like the Goblin there are several Teach Action focussed options, so I will go over them level by level.
##### Minotaur I
This license level provides System save provoking mine/grenades and the Viral Logic Suite which provides two excellent control Invade options.
##### Minotaur II
This allows Metafold Carver, which in turn provides two battlefield positioning Invade options. It also allows Aggressive Systems Sync a non-Invade Full Tech Attack which has two options, either Chains of Prometheus which penalizes a target with Heat for moving away from you, and Excommunicate which penalizes them with Heat for moving adjacent to their allies.
##### Minotaur III
The final level of the Minotaur license unlocks Law of Blades which provides two non-Invade Full Tech Attacks which combined allow you to dictate a sing Weapon Attack, Boost, Stabilize, Improvised Attack, Grapple, or Ram. This level also contains the Interdiction Field, which while not a Tech Attack per se, is excellent at forcing more saves.


### HA
#### <span><font color="green">Iskander</font></span> (S: 15, TA: +1, ST: 12)
The Iskander License only provides one Quick Tech Action which can either make a Blast 3 area of zero gravity or levitate a single target. With strong Sensors and the best Save Target in the core book combined with reasonable defensive stats, it is a strong contender for a hacker's Frame, especially if you utilize it's mine laying Traits to diversify your Saves.

## Invade Options
| Name | Origin | Defense | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fragment Signal | Base | E-Def | Impair and Slowed |
| Jam Cockpit | Hacker II Talent | E-Def | Can't mount or dismount |
| Disable Life Support | Hacker II Talent | E-Def | -1d on Saves |
| Hack./Slash | Hacker II Talent | E-Def | Cannot benefit fromor take Tech Actions |
