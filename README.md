# Lancer Hacking Guide

## What The Hack?
### The Point
This a guide on how Hacking and being a Hacker works in the Lancer system. Hacking in Lancer can mean both aiding your allies and foiling your enemies. Generally you will have a number of interesting decisions to make on your turn as to both whom to effect, and how to effect them. There will be types of enemy that you will be very effective against, like big tanky bosses, and enemies like monstrosities that you are really not. If that sounds interesting, read on. Throughout this guide I will mix explanation with my own analysis, if I miss anything, please feel free to message me or submit a pull request.
### Actions
When I talk about hacking in Lancer I am speaking specifically about the Tech Action. The Tech action can be taken as either a Quick or Full action. There are multiple options for what the Tech action accomplishes, and unlike other actions, the same option can be selected twice by using the Full Tech Action. The starting options are as follows
#### Bolster
This grants +2 dice on a Skill or Save, if a teammate is in a situation where failure is likely or retries are hard, this can be very effective. Take care though to consider action economy for this option.
#### Scan
Providing a few combat details and narrative information, this action is situationally very important.
#### Lock-On
This Action inflicts the Lock-On status to one enemy within sensors. Lock-On can be consumed for a +1 die on an attack roll, as well as triggering many special abilities.
#### Invade
Invade is the primary offensive option, it requires a Tech Attack, and on hit inflicts 2 Heat and a chosen effect. You begin with one effect to choose from and can gain more with Systems upgrades. It is worth noting that all Invades are Tech Attacks, but not all Tech Attacks are Invades.
### Damage vs. Heat
Ranged and Melee Attacks mostly cause Damage, and occasionally add Heat. Tech Attacks mostly cause Heat and occasionally Damage. Each enemy will have a different amount of HP and Heat Cap. Notably, Grunts can be taken out when they suffer any Heat or Damage.
### Support vs. Control
In addition to directly causing Heat or Damage, Mechs can support their allies, or control their enemies. Support is frequently making that ally's actions easier, though it can also be healing, clearing conditions, creating cover etc. Controlling means making an enemy's job harder, this can mean directly causing Conditions and Statuses, making an area dangerous to enter, or dictating actions of an enemy. Tech Actions are good at both of these, but are by no means the only way to accomplish support or control.
### Attacks vs. Saves
Every character has an Evasion and an E-Defense. Tech Attacks always target E-Defense, Ranged or Melee Attacks target Evasion unless they have the Smart tag. Each character also has 4 Saves: Hull, Agility, Systems, and Engineering. Often, high Evasion and Agility saves go hand in hand, as do high E-Defense and System Saves. It is good to both bring a mix of ways to attack an enemy, and to be mindful of what defenses a given enemy might be good at when selecting your mode of attack. For example, if an enemy is described as a slow moving heavily armor Mech, a Tech Attack or Agility save would probably be more effective than a traditional attack or Hull save.

## Building the Character
### Theme or Goal
We know that your character is a hacker, but what are they trying to accomplish? You might want to be a front-line combat hacker who can take a hit and melt their opponents with Heat. You might want to be an evasive hacker who flits in and out of battle assisting their allies. Before getting out of LL0, I would answer two questions about my hacker: 'What kind of Tech Actions do I want to perform?' and 'How am I going to stay alive while I do that?'. 
### HASE
Of the four Mech Skills, Systems is the most important. In addition to providing a bonus to your Tech Attack, it also provides more System Points which can allow your Mech to bring a broader array of tools to accomplish its chosen task. I would caution though against putting too many points into Systems; E-Defense does not increase too much as your LL increases, and Mech Systems aren't any good if you don't find time to use them. Hull and Agility can each increase survivability, and while few Tech Action options suffer from Limited or cost Heat many of the other options for Support or Control do and thus benefit from Engineering.
### Talents
#### Hacker
Needless to say, the Hacker talent is useful for many hacker characters.
Hacker I Provides the victim of a Lock-On Invade with a choice of suffering 2 Heat or moving 3 hexes in a direction you choose. Even if you must provide your own Lock-On before Invading, this can be viable if you are worried about missing or if both options would be bad for the target.
Hacker II Provides three additional Invade options, which are covered in the Invade Option section.
Hacker III Is a Full Tech Attack that causes Burn equal to current Heat, which can be very useful against high Armor targets.
#### Nuclear Cavalier & Infiltrator
Both Nuclear Cavalier I and Infiltrator II provide conditional bonuses to Attacks of any type, which means that you can add Heat (Nuclear Cavalier I) or a Save effect (Infiltrator II) to your Tech Attacks.
#### Spotter
Spotter increases the effectiveness of your Lock-On Tech Action
Spotter I will increase the Support effectiveness of your Lock-On.
Spotter II grants you extra Lock-Ons, and more importantly give you the full defensive profile of anyone you Lock-On, allowing you to select the most effective way to address that enemy.
Spotter III allows you to gift a Quick Action to an adjacent ally when you Lock-On, this can be situationally very powerful, but doesn't increase the overall number of actions your team gets.
### Core Bonuses
There are two Core Bonuses that directly make your Tech Actions better
####  HORUS: THE LESSON OF THINKING-TOMORROWâ€™S THOUGHT
This gives Melee Accuracy and AP+ when you succeed with a Tech Attack, this is an obvious fit for any frontline hacker character.
#### HORUS: THE LESSON OF THE HELD IMAGE
This allows you to Lock-On as a Reaction, as this effectively gives you a free Quick Action every turn it is very powerful and even more so if you have improved your Lock-On with the Spotter Talent.
#### Others
Often, a hacker character will use their Core Bonuses to increase their survivability, but there are a few that deserve special mention.
##### HORUS: THE LESSON OF THE OPEN DOOR
Many Tech Actions provoke saves as do many of the other control options. The combination of the increased Target and the Heat make this essential for anyone relying on Save-based attacks.
##### SSC: GHOSTWEAVE
While this doesn't _directly_ make your Tech Action better, if you are trying to trigger Infiltrator II this Core Bonus can be very useful.

## Building The Mech
When looking at a Mech Frame in regards to your hacker character, it is worth discussing both the Tech Actions etc. that the License grants as well as the suitability of the Frame as a hacker's Mech. Two essential stats for this are the Save Target and the Sensor range, and many Mechs have special abilities that make Tech Actions and their companion actions easier.
### GMS
#### Everest (S: 10, ST:10)
At LL0 this is your Mech, but even at higher LLs it can be a solid hacker platform due to it's special ability and core system. Opening a tough fight with a HYPERSPEC FUEL INJECTOR, Overcharge and INITIATIVE would allow you 4x Accurate Invade Actions and plenty of movement which could change the whole course of the combat.
### IPS-N
#### Lancaster (S: 8, ST: 10)
Even with it's lackluster Sensor stat, the Lancaster is the only dedicated healing Mech in the game, and thus a strong choice for a supportive build. Given the shorter Sensor range it would be good to foocus on Hull to increase both your survivability and Repair Cap.
#### Raleigh (S: 10, ST: 10)
Definitely not a classic hacker platform, the Raleigh bears mentioning due to the Trait FULL METAL JACKET. This Trait allows a free reload of all Loading weapons if you don't make attacks or provoke saves on a turn, which makes a hybrid attack and support build very possible by unloading your weapons and then spending a turn Locking On etc.

### SSC
#### Black Witch (S: 15, ST: 11)
The Black Witch combines good Sensor and Save Target with some strong defensive Traits to make a solid control-centered hacking platform. The ICEOUT Drone (BW II) can be a low-investment way to foil an enemy hacker, as can the Black ICE Module (BW III).

#### Death's Head (S: 20, ST: 10)
The Death's Head II License provides the Tracking Bug Quick Tech option, which is a great way to prevent invisible enemies from giving you trouble. Additionally it's excellent Sensor range makes it a strong candidate for a support artillery hybrid build.

#### Dusk Wing (S: 10, ST: 11)
Neurospike (DW I) provides a couple of good defensive control options, and the rest of the license provides a number of ways to mess with visibility and provoke saves. It is worth noting that the trait Harlequin Cloak is redundant with Infiltrator I for the purposes of triggering Infiltrator II, though it can provide needed enemy Reaction defense.

#### Metal Mark (S: 10, ST: 10)
The Metal Mark License doesn't offer much to directly aid Tech Actions, but both the Core System and Active Camoflauge (MM III) make it very easy to provoke Infiltrator II.

#### Mourning Cloak (S: 15, ST: 10)
The Mourning Cloak license is actually focused around Teleporting hit and run attacks, but the Frame does have good Sensor range and MC II provides Hunter Logic Sweet which allows for two Invade options.

#### Swallowtail (S: 20, ST: 10)
With 20 Sensor range and the trait PROPHETIC SCANNERS, Swallowtail is the gold standard of Lock-On support mechs. The INTEGRATED CLOAK also synergizes nicely with Infiltrator I to set up Infiltrator II. The first License Level provides a Full Tech Attack that causes both Heat and Lock-On, as well as allowing you to use a Reaction to upgrade an ally's hit to a critical; as this competes with Invade + Lock-On it is really only useful if you have an ally that loves crits. Finally the ATHENA-Class NHP can provide AOE Lock-On and the LB/OC Cloaking Field AOE invisibility, bith at the third License Level.
